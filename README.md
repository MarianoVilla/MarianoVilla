## üìö Recommended Readings

I'm a bit of a bookworm, so here are some books that have shaped my thinking:

### Software Engineering & Architecture
- **The Pragmatic Programmer** - *Like a wise uncle giving you life advice, but for coding. The 20th anniversary edition is a must-read IMO.*
- **Fundamentals of Software Architecture** - *Architecture explanations without the ivory tower attitude. Practical and down-to-earth.*
- **The Mythical Man Month** - *Written in 1975, still painfully relevant.*
- **Design Patterns** - *The famous "Gang of Four" book. Like learning chess openings, but for code. Sometimes overkill, often enlightening.*
- **Dive Into Design Patterns** - *A modern, practical take on patterns; got it from the mythical [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) and can't recommend it enough. It also has a solid intro to OOP.*
- **Building Microservices** - *Helped me understand when to split services (and when not to). Also a good intro to architecture, containers and so.*

### Computer Science & Mathematics
- **Algorithms Illuminated** - *Makes algorithm analysis feel less like rocket science and more like solving puzzles. I'm not a math guy, but this book made me feel like I could actually understand it.*
- **Concrete Mathematics** - *A rollercoaster of "I get it!" followed by "Wait, what?" moments. Challenging but rewarding; it's Knuth's book after all.*
- **Book of Proof** - *Made mathematical proofs click for me. I forgot most of it already, but it's a good book to have on your shelf.*
- **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces** - *"Easy" might be stretching it, but it makes OS concepts digestible. Great virtualization explanations.*

### Tools & Infrastructure
- **Network Warrior** - *Friendly, down-to-earth networking book.*
- **Git Internals** - *Understanding Git's belly made me stop treating it like a "save game" button. This is one of the books I also recommend in my [Git In C# project](https://github.com/MarianoVilla/Git-From-Scratch).*
- **The Blockchain Developer** - *Demystifies blockchain beyond the hype. The cryptography chapters alone are worth it.*

### Industry Insights & Others
- **Joel on Software** - *Blog-turned-book that aged like fine wine. The tech changed, but the wisdom remains. Plus, Joel's funny AF.*
- **Soft Skills** - *I absolutely love this book, it has a ton of useful tips for developers and non-devs alike.*
- **The Lean Startup** - *A must-read for anyone who wants to build a startup. It's a bit outdated, but the principles are still valid.*
- **How to F*ck Up a Startup** - *Very funny and insightful startups for those who learn from mistakes (i.e., everyone).*

### Papers & Articles
- **Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures** - *Fielding's dissertation on REST. Also a solid intro to software architecture.*
- **On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models** - *An interesting paper on AI safety.*
- **Concrete Problems in AI Safety** - *Another hard recommend on AI safety. Robert Miles has [a series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqJUIqZNzP8&list=PLqL14ZxTTA4fEp5ltiNinNHdkPuLK4778) about this paper that's also worth a watch.*
